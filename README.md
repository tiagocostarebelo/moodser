# Mooder

A lightweight moodboard editor built with React + TypeScript + Vite for quickly composing ideas with notes, color swatches, and images, then exporting the board as a PNG.


## What you can do

- Create a moodboard with multiple item types (e.g., text notes, colors, images)
- Move and arrange items freely on the board (canvas-style)
- Use a color picker for palette exploration
- Add images from URLs (where allowed) and place them on the board
- Export the board to PNG for sharing or handoff

## Roadmap

- Board persistence (localStorage / file save)
- Import/export as JSON (shareable boards)
- Snapping / guides / alignment helpers
- Keyboard shortcuts (duplicate, delete, nudge, undo/redo)
- Image upload (not just URL)
- Better export options (scale, background, transparent PNG)
